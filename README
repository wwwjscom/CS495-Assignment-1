Jason Soo

I tried getting instruments up and running, but couldn't tell if I 
A) wasn't leaking memory or 
B) I wasn't using it correctly

So most everything in my app is autoreleased.

I coded the following extra parts:
* Retrieve the title of the feed and print it out before the list of story titles
* Include under each title a brief excerpt (perhaps of configurabe length) from the story text and its date of publication -- Note I did not strip the HTMl tags.
